GPS Clock
===

Arduino sketch to pull the time from GPS satelllites. The GPS unit can take
about 5 minutes to aquire satellites, so it's backed by a real-time clock. 

Currently, the time zone offset is hard-coded (-6).  It is also DST by default;
ground D9 to return to standard time.

RTC, GPS, and OLED run at 3.3v. A level-shifter is used to raise the signals
to 5v for the Arduino.
